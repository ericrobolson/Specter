## specter_core
This is the barebones implementation of Nioe. The grammar is incomplete, as it's only goal is the ability to get Specter up and running. Many language features are incomplete, and the only use of this is when compiling Specter to a new target. 

## hello_world
This is a very simple 'Hello World' program to demonstrate how Nioe works.
